# Wildfire's Female Gender Mod

Shappoli provides a compatibility between Apoli/Origins `model_color` power and Wildfire's Wildfire's Female Gender Mod.

Model color changes the color/opacity of the player's model. However, breasts are not affected by this power. This integration fixes it.

See [this](https://github.com/apace100/apoli/pull/60) pull request and [this](https://github.com/WildfireRomeo/WildfireFemaleGenderMod/issues/120) issue for more information.

Thanks to [eth0net](https://github.com/eth0net) for allowing me to use his code as a base for this integration!
