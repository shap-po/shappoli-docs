# Welcome to the Shappoli Documentation

This is the documentation for the Shappoli addon for the Apoli power system of the [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) mod. Please, refer to the [Origins documentation](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for general information about the power system.

To install Shappoli, get the latest release from the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/shappoli) or [releases page](https://github.com/shap-po/shappoli/releases) and drop it into your mods folder. Make sure you are using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and have the [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) mod installed.

Currently Shappoli only supports Minecraft 1.20.4. I may or may not update it to newer versions in the future.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/shap-po/shappoli/issues) if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.
