# Power Types

Power Types are what grants functionality to your origins! Each power has a type, specified with a type field in the JSON. Which type a power is defines which other fields it requires and supports.

!!! Note
    Unless stated otherwise, each power type supports a condition field that can check for [Entity Condition Types](condition/entity.md).
